# BackStack

Needs the following libraries:
- Arduino_LSM6DS3
- Kalman (the version by TKJElectronics)

Other notes:
- Current configured to collect at 104Hz for both acceleration and gyro - not high enough
- Weird spiking problem that might be due to the restricted range to +/- pi - investigate
- No calibration
- No power management
